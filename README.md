# Arithmetic Formatter

The Arithmetic Formatter is a ✨Python✨ program takes an arithmetic equation and displays it vertically.<br>
<br>
The format is specified such that:<br>
✓ a single space separates the operator and the first digit of the larger number<br>
✓ the equation is right aligned<br>
✓ equations are separated by 4 spaces<br>
<br>
⭐️ An option to show the sum or difference is available
<br>
<br>
Errors are also raised when:<br>
🚫 more than 5 equations are given<br>
🚫 multiplication and division are not allowed, only + or - operations are accepted<br>
🚫 characters must be numeric<br>
🚫 operands must also be 4 digits or less<br>
